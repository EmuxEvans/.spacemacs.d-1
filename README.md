# where my Emacs starts 

Here is where my Emacs starts.

After strugling with Emacs configuration for such a long time, I found spacemacs which combine the best part of Emacs an Vim. Actually, I learnt how to use Vim by using spacemacs. 

Right now, I spend even more time using Emacs to fulfill my work because of spacemacs. 

On my personal blog site [zcl.space](zcl.space), there is a section dedicated to my use of Emacs.
